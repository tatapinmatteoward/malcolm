# How to Fix Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) on Windows 10

The Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) is a dreaded sight for any Windows 10 user. Often accompanied by a cryptic error code, it signifies a system crash that requires immediate attention. In this guide, we'll walk you through the most common causes and effective fixes to get your PC back on track.

## Common Causes of BSOD on Windows 10

Before diving into solutions, it's helpful to understand why BSOD occurs. Here are some frequent culprits:

- **Outdated or Corrupt Drivers**: Hardware drivers that are incompatible or damaged can trigger crashes.
- **Faulty Hardware**: Issues with RAM, hard drives, or GPU can cause instability.
- **Software Conflicts**: Recent updates, malware, or incompatible software might be at fault.
- **Overheating**: Excessive heat can lead to system failures.
- **Windows Updates Issues**: Incomplete or failed updates often result in BSOD.

## Step-by-Step Fixes for BSOD

Follow these troubleshooting steps in order. Restart your PC after each fix to check for improvements.

1. **Boot into Safe Mode**
   - Safe Mode loads Windows with minimal drivers, helping isolate the problem.
   - Restart your PC and press Shift + Restart. Navigate to Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Startup Settings > Restart, then select 4 (Safe Mode).

2. **Update Device Drivers**
   - Right-click Start > Device Manager. Check for any devices with a yellow exclamation mark.
   - Visit the manufacturer's website to download the latest drivers.
   - Alternatively, use Windows Update to automatically update drivers.

3. **Run System File Checker (SFC)**
   - Open Command Prompt as administrator.
   - Type `sfc /scannow` and press Enter. This scans and repairs corrupted system files.

4. **Check for Windows Updates**
   - Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update.
   - Install any pending updates, as they often contain bug fixes.

5. **Perform a System Restore**
   - Search for "System Restore" in the Start menu.
   - Choose a restore point from before the BSOD started occurring.
   - This rolls back changes without affecting personal files.

6. **Test Hardware**
   - Use built-in tools like Windows Memory Diagnostic (search for it in Start).
   - For hard drives, run CHKDSK: Open Command Prompt as admin, type `chkdsk /f`.
   - Consider reseating RAM or testing components if needed.

## Advanced Fixes If Basics Fail

- **Disable Fast Startup**: This can sometimes cause conflicts. Go to Control Panel > Power Options > Choose what the power buttons do > Change settings that are currently unavailable > Uncheck "Turn on fast startup".
- **Run Malware Scans**: Use Windows Defender or third-party tools like Malwarebytes.
- **Reset or Clean Install Windows**: As a last resort, back up your data and perform a reset via Settings > Update & Security > Recovery.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, the BSOD might indicate a hardware failure, and you should consult a professional technician.

Remember, preventing BSOD involves regular maintenance: keep drivers updated, use reliable antivirus, and avoid overloading your system. Stay proactive to minimize downtime!
